## 🚀 Next Steps (When Ready)

### Immediate: Create Notebooks (Priority)

The infrastructure is 100% ready. Now write the teaching materials:

**Week 1**: Notebooks 1-2 (RNN and basic attention)
- Use the modules you've built
- Add narrative markdown cells
- Create compelling visualizations
- Show the "aha!" moments

**Week 2**: Notebooks 3-4 (Transformer blocks and full models)
- Assemble components
- Train on real tasks
- Benchmark performance
- Analyze attention patterns

**Week 3**: Notebooks 5-6 (Modern variants and ODEs)
- Connect to current research
- Show cutting edge
- Highlight Canadian work
- Polish all materials

### Future: Enhancements (Optional)

- **Interactive web demos** (Plotly Dash)
- **Video walkthroughs** (YouTube series)
- **Blog post** announcing release
- **Workshop materials** (slides, exercises)
- **Additional architectures** (Perceiver, Reformer)
- **Unit tests** (pytest suite)

## 📝 How to Use This Delivery

### Option 1: Continue Building (Recommended)
Start writing Notebook 1 using the infrastructure. Everything is ready:
```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '../src')
from maze_envs import generate_simple_maze
# ... build from here
```

### Option 2: Review & Plan
Read through:
1. PROJECT_STATUS.md - see what's next
2. QUICK_REFERENCE.md - understand the APIs
3. docs/mazes_in_ai_history.md - get inspired by history
4. The source code - see implementation details

Then plan your notebook structure.

### Option 3: Release Phase 1
You could release this infrastructure **now** with a note:
"Notebooks coming soon - star/watch for updates!"

This builds anticipation and gets early feedback.

> **The Maze and The Map: Understanding Transformers Through Code**
> 
> When you're lost in a maze, you can either walk it step-by-step (RNN) or fly overhead with a map (Transformer). This repository teaches transformer architecture by building it from scratch, using maze-solving to make abstract concepts concrete.
> 
> From Shannon's mechanical mouse (1950) to Neural ODEs (2018), featuring Toronto's contributions to deep learning 🇨🇦
> 
> [GitHub link]
> 
> Start with RNNs, build attention mechanisms, assemble transformers, explore modern variants - all through progressive implementation with rich visualizations.
