# The Maze and The Map: Understanding Transformers Through Code


🐁 MICE IN ꩜ MAZES WITH 🗺️ MAPS: 
Understanding Transformers Through Code

🤔 Thinking about how transformers work and why they triggered the LLM revolution. 🙄 Hence, asked a transformer-based AI (of course) to write a sequence of experiments to help me understand them from the ground up.

꩜ Turns out MAZES are perfect for this. They've been part of AI since Claude Shannon built his 🐁 mechanical mouse in 1950. What makes them special is they force you to deal with the core challenge: understanding sequential dependencies and long-range connections.

 🦾 Our trusty transformer put together a learning package that builds from RNNs ₪🐁₪ (the "MOUSE IN THE MAZE" approach) through ‼️ ATTENTION MECHANISMS to 🦾 FULL TRANSFORMERS, modern variants like SPARSE ATTENTION and RoPE, and even NEURAL ODEs. Six progressive notebooks, with code, trained models showing actual results.

🇨🇦 The CANADIAN CONNECTION runs deep here. From Hinton's BACKPROPAGATION to Bahdanau's ATTENTION MECHANISM to Duvenaud's NEURAL ODES at University of Toronto. These weren't incremental improvements - they were fundamental shifts in how we think about learning and computation.

😲 What might be surprising how the 〰️ CONTINUOUS perspective (Neural ODEs) connects back to ☰ DISCRETE transformer layers. Transformers aren't just clever engineering - they're discrete approximations to continuous dynamics. That insight opens doors to adaptive computation and hybrid models.

🔮 This isn't just historical curiosity. Understanding WHY transformers work, not just HOW, matters as we look at alternatives like STATE SPACE MODELS and whatever comes next. ꩜ Mazes remain a proving ground because they're simple enough to understand but complex enough to stress test architectures.

 🧀 If, like me, you're trying to understand transformers beyond the API level, join me searching for the bait.
